Poker AI for heads-up limit hold'em

This is the source code for Poker AI ZBot, that did well in the Annual Computer Poker Competition (http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/) 2011-2013.

It's almost completely undocumented, and frankly I don't quite remember how to use it. Vast majority of the source code files are probably not needed to create the strategy, but are just some tests or half baked ideas.

AI uses Counterfactual Regret Minimization to calculate a strategy for a custom board/hand state abstraction.

If there is any interest, I could try to clean it up a bit, with a guide to create a simple strategy
